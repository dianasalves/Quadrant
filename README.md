# Quadrant


  It is a computer tool that allows you to carry out an analysis based on quadrants such as the SWOT analysis. Therefore, each of the quadrant-based analyzes is named 
Technique. Each technique will be associated with a number of questions related to each of the quadrants and duly weighted. With the overall score of each of the 
quadrants, it is possible to determine the placement of each one in the generated graph. All techniques and analyzes carried out are stored in a database and can be 
consulted at any time by the user who created them.

  In this tool, the user can create and manage their own account.
  
  By default, the first user on the system is the system administrator. It manages users and can make registered users system administrators.
  
  User types are differentiated through a field called "Category". The system administrator has the category "-1". By default, when a user registers in the system, 
category "1" is assigned to him. When the system administrator makes a registered user a system administrator, the user is assigned category "0". There is still a 
category "2" relevant in case the user is blocked from logging in to the application, or using the system.
